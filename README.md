# Heriseon HTML/CSS Refactor

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create efficient code for my client. Personally, I built the project to demonstrate and expand my knowledge on refactoring HTML and CSS. I built this project to make the code more concise and accessible for the hypothetical marketing agency Horiseon. It is an excercise in refactoring semantic elements and CSS elements. The refactoring that I have done in this project makes the code more readable and accessible. Before refactoring the lacked structure due to a scarcity of semantic elements. The images now have alt attributes which will assist people with screen readers access their website. I learned more about the 'article' and 'aside' elements which will be useful in future project building. I also leanred more about combining classes and ids in CSS.
