# Random Password Generator

## Description

I created this application in order to satify the client's desire for a random password generator that lets the user set their own criteria for better security. I personally built the project to apply my knowledge of Javascript functions, if statements, and methods.  This generator lets the user specify if they want their password to have upper case or lower case letters, special characters, or numeric characters. The input of the user is then used to produce a randomized password with their chosen criteria. This project challenged my ability to break down a task down into smaller parts. I expanded my knowledge of the 'concat' method and 'while loops'.
